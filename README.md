Software-Design-Spring-2014-Final-Project
=========================================

This is the base repository for the Software Design Spring 2014 Final Project, SmarterBoard. We have currently split up into two groups. One group is working on rendering a clean circuit diagram from a drawing and the other group is working on compiling programs from hand-written code.

The members working on this project are Ryan Louie, Sarah Walters, Doyung Lee, and Zoher Ghadyali
