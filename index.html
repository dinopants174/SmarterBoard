<p>
  <strong>Design Pipeline</strong>
  <br>
Our software takes an image of a hand-drawn circuit diagram as input. First, we look for wires in the diagram by scanning the image for rows and columns with an average darkness darker than a defined threshold; then, we identify intersections and separate the diagram into line segments. We proceed to rotate each segment so that it is horizontal as this allows us to run our component finder. We move left to right along each line looking for irregularities. Upon finding an irregularity, we crop an image of the located component from the diagram, and we use our component classifier to identify what component is there. We store the connections between and the locations of the components and segments, and finally we produce our initial goal of a nicely rendered circuit diagram while also producing a list of objects that the RESISTOR team can use.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Design Story</strong>
  <br>
After talking to the ninjas about performing OCR on a whiteboard and generating notes based on the content on the whiteboard, we decided that this was too general a project. Instead, we broke up into two teams in order to pursue two different ideas involving OCR. One group worked on compiling handwritten code while another worked on a hand-drawn circuit diagram renderer. After beta-testing each project for a week, we made the decision to focus entirely on the circuit diagram project. This decision was made based on code that we modified from research papers which functioned incredibly well. It was also due to the struggle of retraining the module we were using, Tesseract, to perform OCR on handwriting and the fact that Tesseract was trained off of English and was not recognizing code. We were able to reach the minimum deliverables we had for both projects and then decided that the circuit diagram project just had much more room to grow and do interesting work than the hand-written code compiler.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Data Structure</strong>
  <br>
Through our image segmentation algorithm, we produce a list of line segment elements. Each line segment element is an object which stores the connections the segment has, the components it contains, and likely its relative location in the frame (vertical vs. horizontal, left side vs. right We will be able to refactor our data structure into a structure which interfaces with the RESISTOR team (they’re producing breadboard layouts from graphical representations of circuit diagrams): they don’t need any of the relative location information, but everything related to connections is relevant to their project as well as to ours.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Development Plan</strong>
  <br>
In terms of further development, we have four main tasks we need to complete. We need to create a segmentation algorithm that will read a circuit diagram and separate it based on intersections. Sarah has been working primarily on this algorithm. We also need to retool and refactor our component classifier such that it works with the black and white thresholded images that our component finder outputs. This will primarily be Ryan’s responsibility. Our third goal is to construct the data type mentioned above and produce a list of these segment objects where each object contains the connections of each segment. We will probably pursue this as a group, integrating all the data we have into these objects. Finally, we want to look at a single segment and produce a clean, rendered drawing of that segment, containing appropriate lines, resistors, and capacitors which is what Doyung and Zoher will work on.

<p>
  <strong>Design Pipeline</strong>
  <br>
We input a hand-drawn circuit diagram, we define a reading frame that moves through the diagram, we check where the wires are by finding lines at a certain threshold for darkness, and we move along the line, looking for irregularities. Upon finding an irregularity, we define a component there and we use our component classifier to identify what component is there. Finally, we produce our initial goal of a nicely rendered circuit diagram while also producing a list of objects that the RESISTOR team can use.

<p>
  <strong>Data Structure</strong>
  <br>
We’ve just decided on the way we’re planning to store graphical representations of circuit diagrams after we read them from images. We’re open to interfacing with the RESISTOR team (they’re producing breadboard layouts from graphical representations of circuit diagrams), and we used our first design review with them in part to decide on a data structure which will be common to both of our teams.
<br><br>
Each component in the circuit will be stored as an object of the class ‘Component’. That class will include an attribute, ‘connections’, which is a dictionary mapping from component pin number to a list of Component objects connected to that pin. We will consider resistors and capacitors to be components with two pins (ie for a resistor or capacitor ‘connections’ will have two keys, 1 and 2, which correspond to two lists of components).
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Development Plan</strong>
  <br>
Since our team split up between code-compiler and circuit-reader previously, we met and reorganized tasks. Now that the team’s focus was on the circuit-reader, we allocated tasks to each of our members: Zoher and Doyung will work on the component-detection of the program (finding where resistors, capacitors, etc. are on a wire line), Sarah will continue working on line-detection (she already has a basic version and is going to improve it) and Ryan will work on creating a drawing given a list of intersections and component location. These parts will not interfere with each other, but Sarah, Doyung and Zoher will work closely together for this set of tasks because the line detection and component detection are related. The team meets every week with a deliverable, in which we both explain how we coded our tasks and show how far we got (to let other team members understand the code as well as scope our tasks appropriately).

<strong>Who We Are</strong>
<br>
We are a team of 4 students from Olin College taking a Software Design course. Our project focuses on performing optical character recognition, OCR, to create a rendered circuit diagram based off of a hand-drawn schematic. Our members consist of Ryan Louie <a href="https://github.com/themythicaldrago" class="user-mention">@themythicaldrago</a>, Sarah Walters <a href="https://github.com/swalters4925" class="user-mention">@swalters4925</a>, Doyung Lee <a href="https://github.com/doyunglee" class="user-mention">@doyunglee</a>, and Zoher Ghadyali <a href="https://github.com/dinopants174" class="user-mention">@dinopants174</a>.
<br><br>
This project is designed to integrate with the R.E.S.I.S.T.O.R team. Our project will generate the circuit diagram while the R.E.S.I.S.T.O.R team will use our diagram and data to demonstrate what the circuit would look like on a breadboard. We do plan on creating a product electrical engineers and students can use in everday life and interfacing with R.E.S.I.S.T.O.R will help us achieve that goal.
</p>

<p>
<strong>What Will It Do?</strong>
<br>
The blue-sky goal of the project is to provide a suite of services that demonstrate practical uses of OCR. We have come up with a list of applications that convert images to documents containing the text within the images. These include: a note generator using text on a whiteboard, a code compiler using hand-written code, a Wolfram Alpha type service using hand-written equations or graphs, a clean rendering of a circuit diagram from a hand-drawn image, and a translator using an image of text in another language.
<br><br>
The project will be centered around the circuit schematic renderer - a piece of software which produces a clean, professional circuit diagram using a hand-drawn diagram. Our minimum deliverable for this project would be to render the clean diagram using simple RC circuits. If we finish this project and still have time, we may pursue some of our extensions or simply focus on creating a very professional and easy to use web-app or GUI.
<br><br>
We could extend the core of the project by creating some of the other tools in the software suite and using them in conjunction with the circuit diagram generator. The software would organize the data into an appropriate structure - titles, lists, tables, etc. We also have several extensions in mind concerning the specific tools we’ve thought about - the circuit diagram and graph tools could read equations and data from circuits and graphs; the circuit diagram tool could also produce vector graphics with moveable components instead of flat images. Similarly, the image-to-text converter could translate the words it reads from an image. Lastly, if we find we have plenty of time to do so, we’re potentially interested in creating a mobile or web app which makes our product usable.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Challenges Along the Way</strong>
<br>
There are some questions we need to answer in order to begin work on this project. We need to know where the wires of the circuit diagram are and how they are connected and we need to be able to understand the connections of the components in the diagram in order to interface with R.E.S.I.S.T.O.R. One problem that comes to mind is how to deal with components more complicated than resistors and capacitors that have multiple wires and connections flowing into and out of the component.
<br><br>
What we have found doing just a little bit of research are packages that perform OCR for us in Python. However, we realize that using these packages does not really help us achieve our goal of performing OCR ourselves. In addition, we are doing OCR on circuit diagrams, which will mean we cannot use traditional OCR packages that trained off of English and type.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Where We Need Help</strong>
<br>
We do not have an angel adviser in mind, but we would appreciate one whose expertise is in computer vision and image processing, or further down the road potentially one who has skills related to mobile development (from Python).
