<strong>Updates on What We Have Done</strong>

</p>

<p>
<strong>Who We Are</strong>
<br>
We are a team of 4 students from Olin College taking a Software Design course. Our project focuses on performing optical character recognition, OCR, to create a rendered circuit diagram based off of a hand-drawn schematic. Our members consist of Ryan Louie <a href="https://github.com/themythicaldrago" class="user-mention">@themythicaldrago</a>, Sarah Walters <a href="https://github.com/swalters4925" class="user-mention">@swalters4925</a>, Doyung Lee <a href="https://github.com/doyunglee" class="user-mention">@doyunglee</a>, and Zoher Ghadyali <a href="https://github.com/dinopants174" class="user-mention">@dinopants174</a>.
<br><br>
This project is designed to integrate with the R.E.S.I.S.T.O.R team. Our project will generate the circuit diagram while the R.E.S.I.S.T.O.R team will use our diagram and data to demonstrate what the circuit would look like on a breadboard. We do plan on creating a product electrical engineers and students can use in everday life and interfacing with R.E.S.I.S.T.O.R will help us achieve that goal.
</p>

<p>
<strong>What Will It Do?</strong>
<br>
The blue-sky goal of the project is to provide a suite of services that demonstrate practical uses of OCR. We have come up with a list of applications that convert images to documents containing the text within the images. These include: a note generator using text on a whiteboard, a code compiler using hand-written code, a Wolfram Alpha type service using hand-written equations or graphs, a clean rendering of a circuit diagram from a hand-drawn image, and a translator using an image of text in another language.
<br><br>
The project will be centered around the circuit schematic renderer - a piece of software which produces a clean, professional circuit diagram using a hand-drawn diagram. Our minimum deliverable for this project would be to render the clean diagram using simple RC circuits. If we finish this project and still have time, we may pursue some of our extensions or simply focus on creating a very professional and easy to use web-app or GUI.
<br><br>
We could extend the core of the project by creating some of the other tools in the software suite and using them in conjunction with the circuit diagram generator. The software would organize the data into an appropriate structure - titles, lists, tables, etc. We also have several extensions in mind concerning the specific tools we’ve thought about - the circuit diagram and graph tools could read equations and data from circuits and graphs; the circuit diagram tool could also produce vector graphics with moveable components instead of flat images. Similarly, the image-to-text converter could translate the words it reads from an image. Lastly, if we find we have plenty of time to do so, we’re potentially interested in creating a mobile or web app which makes our product usable.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Challenges Along the Way</strong>
<br>
There are some questions we need to answer in order to begin work on this project. We need to know where the wires of the circuit diagram are and how they are connected and we need to be able to understand the connections of the components in the diagram in order to interface with R.E.S.I.S.T.O.R. One problem that comes to mind is how to deal with components more complicated than resistors and capacitors that have multiple wires and connections flowing into and out of the component.
<br><br>
What we have found doing just a little bit of research are packages that perform OCR for us in Python. However, we realize that using these packages does not really help us achieve our goal of performing OCR ourselves. In addition, we are doing OCR on circuit diagrams, which will mean we cannot use traditional OCR packages that trained off of English and type.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Where We Need Help</strong>
<br>
We do not have an angel adviser in mind, but we would appreciate one whose expertise is in computer vision and image processing, or further down the road potentially one who has skills related to mobile development (from Python).

<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
