<p>
<strong>Who We Are</strong>
<br>
We are a team of 4 students from Olin College taking a Software Design course. Our project focuses on performing optical character recognition, OCR, to create a document containing the relevant text in a given photograph. Our members consist of Ryan Louie @themythicaldrago, Sarah Walters @swalters4925, Doyung Lee @doyunglee, and Zoher Ghadyali @dinopants174.
<br>
Although this project is not designed to integrate with another group’s project, we do plan on creating something that is useful in everyday life, from interpreting signs in other languages to generating notes from the text on a whiteboard.
</p>

<p>
<strong>What Will It Do?</strong>
<br>
The blue-sky goal of the project is to provide a suite of services that demonstrate practical uses of OCR. We have come up with a list of applications that convert images to documents containing the text within the images. These include: a note generator using text on a whiteboard, a code compiler using hand-written code, a Wolfram Alpha type service using hand-written equations or graphs, a clean rendering of a circuit diagram from a hand-drawn image, and a translator using an image of text in another language.
<br>
The project will be centered around the whiteboard note generator - a piece of software which produces a text file from an uploaded photo of a whiteboard which contains just text.  If it turns out that OCR on handwriting is far more difficult than we’re currently anticipating, our minimum deliverable will be a program which produces a .txt file from an uploaded photo of a typed document.  We plan to begin by locating a Python package which performs OCR and writing an interface which allows it to identify images of single handwritten characters.
<br>
We could extend the core of the project by creating some of the other tools in the software suite and using them in conjunction with the text converter on a photo of a whiteboard which contains both text and images. The software would organize the data into an appropriate structure - titles, lists, tables, etc. We also have several extensions in mind concerning the specific tools we’ve thought about - the circuit diagram and graph tools could read equations and data from circuits and graphs; the circuit diagram tool could also produce vector graphics with moveable components instead of flat images. Similarly, the image-to-text converter could translate the words it reads from an image. Lastly, if we find we have plenty of time to do so, we’re potentially interested in creating a mobile or web app which makes our product usable.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Challenges Along the Way</strong>
<br>
There are some questions we need to answer in order to begin work on this project. We need to determine what format, other than .txt, could we produce our output document in. We also must find a method to discern whether some text is part of an image or not and we also must differentiate between a collection of lines that forms an image versus a letter. 
<br>
What we have found doing just a little bit of research are packages that perform OCR for us in Python. However, we realize that using these packages does not really help us achieve our goal of performing OCR ourselves. A hurdle we will face is finding the right balance between using useful and efficient modules and doing the work ourselves. In addition, another problem we may face is choosing to pursue a project that does not have an easy and established API for us to use. This would increase our work exponentially. 
<br>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Where We Need Help</strong>
<br>
We do not have an angel adviser in mind, but we would appreciate one whose expertise is in computer vision and image processing, or further down the road potentially one who has skills related to mobile development (from Python).

<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
